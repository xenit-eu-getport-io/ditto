# XeniT Ditto

XeniT Ditto provides an API to build test data-sets and test doubles for [Alfresco Content Repository](https://alfresco.com)
for data-centric integration tests.

The intention is that applications that use an Alfresco remote API, don't need to spin up a full Alfresco systems for
various integration tests, but can use this library in-process.

# XeniT Ditto

XeniT Ditto mimics the Alfresco data model an provides an API to build test Alfresco data-sets and test doubles for [Alfresco Content Repository](https://alfresco.com)
remote api clients.

This is useful in data-centric integration tests where the system under test, depends on Alfresco. You don't need to
spin up a full Alfresco and load it with test-data for every test, but use a drop-in-replacement test-doubles instead.
